We know that wind and solar energy for instance aren't 100% clean. The question is exactly how much CO2 per kWh is emitted and how does that compare to fossil fuels. A brand of shirts made out of recycled bottles claims to be sustainable, but how does turning the bottles into fabric compare with other man-made materials? And exactly how does it compare to organic cotton or linen?</p><p>Life cycle assessments (LCA) cut through marketing claims and churn complex manufacturing processes into a number you can use to compare across different products and services.</p><p>A university course on LCA implanted the tiniest alarm bell in my ear that goes off every time I hear an unsubstantiated sustainability claim. These claims come from a place of good intentions, but unless they're quantified it's hard to make informed consumer decisions.</p><p>The same way consumers learned to read nutritional labels, I don't think adding a label with CO2 emissions and water use is that much of a stretch. Once it becomes common practice, this type of information can actually become a differentiating factor for brands given how consumer awareness regarding environmental issues has increased dramatically in the past few years.</p><p>In practical terms perhaps, having small brands doing LCA for each product might not be realistic, but I see no other way of making quick progress as consumers get trapped in greenwashing and marketing noise.</p><p>So what exactly is an LCA? From the <a href="http://pqm-online.com/assets/files/lib/std/iso_14040-2006.pdf">ISO 14040</a>, an LCA is an ISO framework to measure the environmental impact of products and services. It considers the entire life cycle of a product, from raw material extraction and acquisition, through energy and material production and manufacturing, to use and end of life treatment and final disposal.</p><p>One of the intended uses and perhaps the more relevant for what we discussed in the Decora podcast is &quot;(...)marketing  (e.g.  implementing  an  ecolabelling  scheme,  making  an  environmental  claim,  or  producing  an  environmental product declaration).&quot; Also, the framework has the notion of comparative assertion: an &quot;environmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product versus a competing product that performs the same function&quot;</p><p>The LCA has four stages:</p><ul><li>the goal and scope definition phase,</li><li>the inventory analysis phase,</li><li>the impact assessment phase, and</li><li>the    interpretation    phase.</li></ul><p><img alt="..." src="/assets/img/life-cycle-assessment-decora-edit/lca.png" title="..." /></p><p>A key aspect of the LCA is the functional unit: &quot;functional unit quantifies performance of a product system for use as a reference unit&quot;. In the example above is kWh - energy produced, but it can be a shirt or square meter of fabric, if we're talking about the fashion industry. &quot;All subsequent analyses are then relative to that functional unit, as all inputs and outputs in the LCA (...) are related to the functional unit.&quot;</p><p>I went on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-decora-edit/id1551021379">Decora Edit Podcast</a> to speak with Giulia about this topic.
