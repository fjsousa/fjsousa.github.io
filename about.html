I work mainly with javascript and clojure. I work best in small teams where devs have full ownership of the features produced.</p><p>After a university degree in mechanical engineering with a strong focus on energy and fluid computational analysis, I worked at a uni lab doing fluid flow analysis for external clients for a couple of years.</p><p>Around 2013 I left the lab  and eventually worked for a couple of startups in the booming Lisbon startup scene.</p><p>In 2015 I moved to London and worked for E-commerce, entertainment and financial services, leaving in 2020 after getting a remote job.</p><p>In 2016 I created a project using open driving license pass rates, that contributed to better transparency in an otherwise opaque sector of the Portuguese economy.</p><p>Currently I'm focused primarily in distributed systems and numerical problems.</p><p>Outside of work, I've grappled in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu on and off for about a decade, having attended 3 competitions in London, winning a 2nd place in one of them. After a 10 day meditation retreat in 2018, I've been a regular meditator and I've recently joined London's branch of the Great Debators Club.</p><p>If you want to get in touch please email me at mail@fjsousa.com.</p><p><img .="" 2020""="" alt="" at="" de="" lisbon,="" me="" monsanto,="" october="" panoramico="" src="assets/img/about/about.jpg" title="Me at Panoramico de Monsanto, Lisbon, October 2020" /></p><p>What I've been up to these past years:</p><ul><li>BJJ: 3 comps</li><li>5 years in London</li><li>entrepeneur comps</li><li>prize money</li><li>speaker in confs</li><li>meditation course and practice</li><li>coursera courses</li><li>section on 3 books, 3 songs, 3 movies, 3 whateverdebaters club</li><li>places I worked for</li><li>put cv</li><li>Zuper in Space</li></ul><h2>Highlighted projects</h2><ul><li>GPU based forest fire simulation.
