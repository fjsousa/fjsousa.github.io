I'm a software engineer currently working as an independent contractor. I work mainly with javascript and clojure. I work best in small teams where devs have full ownership of the features produced.

After a university degree in mechanical engineering with a strong focus on energy and fluid computational analysis, I worked at a uni lab doing fluid flow analysis for external clients for a couple of years.

Around 2013 I left the lab  and eventually worked for a couple of startups in the booming Lisbon startup scene.

In 2015, I moved to London and worked for E-commerce, entertainment and financial services, leaving in 2020 after getting a remote job.


In 2016, I created a project using open driving licence pass rates, that contributed to better transparency in an otherwise opaque sector of the Portuguese economy.

Currently I'm focused primarily in distributed systems and numerical problems.

Outside of work, I've grappled in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu on and off for about a decade, having attended 3 competitions in London, winning a 2nd place in one of them. After a 10 day meditation retreat in 2018, I've been a regular meditator and I've recently joined London's branch of the Great Debaters Club.

What I've been up to these past years:

## Highlighted projects

- GPU based forest fire simulation and algorithm optimization - 2010. Still [available on github](https://github.com/fjsousa/cudaFGM)
- [Open driving license pass rates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZm0paShVMw&feature=youtu.be) - 2016
- At youview, I've charged the early refactoring efforts of a set of microservices, consolidating them into more maintainable smaller services and reducing the aws budget significantly. - 2019
- Game development prototyping in C++ and Construct for what would latter become a children's educational game: Zuper in Space - 2010

## White papers

- Simulation of surface fire fronts using firelib and GPUs, 2011. [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815212001867)
- Faster than real time stochastic fire spread simulations, 2011. [Link](http://www.techscience.com/cmes/2012/v89n5_index.html)

## Awards

- 2nd place in the Msc. Category of the Fraunhofer Challenge. The contest is an academic competition
that awards research with practical utility. ​ My project​ was a mobile app that enabled fire-fighters to turn
smartphones into fire simulators, by feeding data to models running in remote servers. 2011
- ISCTE-IUL MIT Venture Competition – Semi-finalist. Contributed with fluid flow analysis of a
high-altitude, floating wind turbine. The project was one of the 20 semi finalists in a startup pitch competition
for a prize up to 1 million Euros. 2011
