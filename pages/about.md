I'm a software engineer currently working as an independent contractor through [Codecadre](https://codecadre.ai). I work mainly with javascript and clojure.

After a university degree in mechanical engineering with a strong focus in energy and fluid computational analysis, I worked at a university lab doing fluid flow analysis for external clients for a couple of years.

Around 2013 I left the lab and eventually worked for a couple of startups in the booming Lisbon startup scene.

In 2015, I moved to London and worked for E-commerce, entertainment and financial services, leaving in 2020 after getting a remote job.


In 2016, I created a personal project using open driving licence pass rates, that contributed to better transparency in an otherwise opaque sector of the Portuguese economy.

Currently, I'm focused primarily in distributed systems and numerical problems.

Outside of work, I've grappled in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu on and off for about a decade, having attended 3 competitions in London, winning a 2nd place in one of them. After a 10 day meditation retreat in 2018, I've been a regular meditator and I've recently joined London's branch of the Great Debaters Club.
