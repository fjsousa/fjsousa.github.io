Subtitle: This is a video of a high-speed train simulation I did while working for a university research lab (Lasef) in Lisbon. The simulation and post processing were carried out using a commercial software called Start-CCm+ and a custom Java script. This video is purely aesthetic however it is based on the actual simulation we carried out. Email me if you're interested in accessing the conference paper.
