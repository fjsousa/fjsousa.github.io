This is not a theory of consciousness

* Maybe intro

Can't precisely say when it became a leading question in my life but like many, at some point I became, perhaps pointlessly, obsessed with the question of consciousness.

What makes this such a hard line of enquire is the elusive nature of the actual subject. You spend your whole life with it staring you right in the face and yet you can't see it.

Most of the past few years were spent in the equivalent of knocking on closed doors. I would start a book or an article that stated it had a theory of consciousness, only to reach the end thinking "no wait, this isn't quite it actually".

So what is the nature of the subject?

At this point I'm keeping my hopes very low regarding we actually crack this one over my life time. Some things have become clear however and I want to leave some breadcrumbs to whomever comes next.

I'll write my thoughts as a series "This is not a theory of consciousness" and if works allow I'll post more than one article.

* GEB

First, a few notions from what must be an absolute read in the field of conscious studies.

GEB is an awakening experience of sorts and the amount of insights I got from it fails only to have come so late in my life. For the context of this article I'll mention only these few:

- In what ways a network of interconnected cells firing on a given activation threshould can can represent concepts.
- How can a brain represent concepts ever more complex where it starts looping back and having representations about itself.
- limits that systems that represent information have about generating all information there is too generate.

Douglas Hofstadter accomplishes this by first coming up a toy mathematics to explain what formal systems are.

Is DH pointing that the brain is a formal system?

....

Machines are capable of having human like reasoning without having to necessarily have consciousness.


However, I left the book with the notion that human brains can act human and nowhere there's a need for consciouness for this information processing to happen.

I was late to the party. This notion was stated my Chalmers in the 90s as the hard problem of consciousness. If you're reading this at this point you're familiar with it so I won't go in detail.
