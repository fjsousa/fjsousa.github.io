This is not a theory of consciousness

I'm just an ignoramus unhappy with the current offering of theories of consciousness by the establishment.

I'm not part of the establishment, which is why I can link videos, podcasts, ill formed opinions and other. My aim is to help others save time and hopefully get to the matter faster.

Why do we need this?

I believe we've been taking ever greater strides in our cognitive nieche, and that consciousness is a medium, the same way birds learned to explore lift in fluids, so we learned to explore subjective experience that SOMEHOW arises from what goes on in our brains, to represent the complexity of the world around us into constructs that our bodies were able to take advantage of.



* Maybe intro

Can't precisely say when it became a leading question in my life but like many, perhaps pointlessly, I became obsessed with the question of consciousness.

What makes this such a hard line of enquire is the elusive nature of the actual subject. You spend your whole life with it staring you in the face and yet you can't see it what's wrong it.

Most of the past few years were spent in the equivalent of knocking on closed doors. I would start a book or an article that stated it had a theory of consciousness, only to reach the end thinking "no wait, this isn't quite it actually".

So what is the nature of the subject?

At this point I'm keeping my hopes very low regarding we actually crack this one over my life time. Some things have become clear however and I want to leave some breadcrumPbs to whomever comes next.

I'll write my thoughts as a series "This is not a theory of consciousness" and if works allow I'll post more than one article.

* GEB

> Machines are capable of having human like reasoning without having to necessarily have consciousness.

First, a few notions from what must be an absolute read in the field of conscious studies.

GEB is an awakening experience of sorts and the amount of insights I got from it fails only to have come so late in my life. For the context of this article I'll mention only these few:

- How human language arises from the firing pattern of neurons. And how language can be "skimmed off" and transplanted into a computer program

Another idea that struck me as important was the fact that language, which arises from the firing patterns of neurons, can be up to a certain degree, skimmed off and transplanted into a software program.

- How machines can process information without the need for subjective experience.

The same way that a piece of DNA carries passive meaning that gets mindlessly interpreted by the cell to produce all the building blocks for life (or viruses), so a computer program doesnâ€™t need subjective experience to process information that can be in every sense as complex as life itself.


- How an information processing system (a brain or computer program) represent concepts ever more complex where it starts looping back and having representations about itself - WITHOUT THE NEED OF CONSCIOUS experience.
- limits that systems that represent information have about generating all information there is too generate.

- how a brain operates in the same way of an ant colony. Do we expect and colonies to be conscious? Maybe they can represents themselves in the way they operate, but expecting an ant colony to have subjective experience would be counter intuitive, and yet, our brains do just that - they're a collection of neurons - simpler even than ants.

I started the book having some of these notions in mind. After all I'm a software programmer and I rely on machines doing their bid of complex information processing. However, Douglas Hofstadter takes you by the hand through the scenic route of human reasoning, first laying out a bare bones mathematics to explain how proofs work, then
Douglas Hofstadter accomplishes this by first coming up a toy mathematics to explain what formal systems are. How to mechanically produce knowledge using rules of maths. how these rules can be mechanised, the limits of these rules. How concepts are represent on top of each others, to ever more complex degrees. how this can eventually loop back and represent itself. What's left out is the need for subjective experience. Two roads I've seen:

I was late to the party. This notion was stated my Chalmers in the 90s as the hard problem of consciousness. If you're reading this at this point you're familiar with it so I won't go in detail.

The other option is it being an ilusion:
